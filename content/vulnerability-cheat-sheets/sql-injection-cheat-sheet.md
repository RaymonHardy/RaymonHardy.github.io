All need to use parameterize queries. This is going into each programming language and how to remeidate. 

## Java
Use the `preparedStatement` interface. This is a built in JDBC (java querying of databases) API interface functionality that allows you to set parametrized queries and escape special characters. 

For Example:

```
}
    PreparedStatement pstmt = con.prepareStatement("UPDATE EMPLOYEES SET SALARY = ? WHERE ID = ?");
    pstmt.setBigDecimal(1, 153833.00)
    pstmt.setInt(2, 110592)
}
```

There you can see you have the function .setBigDecimal() and .setInt() to make sure it is coming in the format that it should and will escape special characters like quotations marks and parenthesis.
